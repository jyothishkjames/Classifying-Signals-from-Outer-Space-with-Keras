# Classifying-Signals-from-Outer-Space-with-Keras


Getting Started
---------------

This repository implements a deep learning model to classify different radio signals from
outer space. The different signals include "squiggle", "narrowband", "noise" and
"narrowbanddrd".


Prerequisites
-------------

    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    tensorflow
    livelossplot


Dataset
-------

Here, we use the SETI Dataset. The dataset is a csv file which encodes information  of
images. 

How to train the model?
